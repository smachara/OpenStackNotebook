====== 2 RDO Installation ======
Created Thursday 17 March 2016

Manual installation and configuration of [[OpenStack]] involves  
	Installing, configuring and registering 
		1. each of the components
		2. multiple databases 
		3. a messaging system.
It's a very involved, repetitive, error-prone, and sometimes-confusing process.
Fortunately, there are a few tools to automate this installation and configuration process

Packstack is an install tool for [[OpenStack]] all-in-one installation or multi-node instalation.

Packstack uses:
		**SSH** connect to each of the nodes
		**puppet  **on each of the nodes to install and configure OpenStack.
Configuration of **Neutron** is slightly different for an all-in-one single-server installation as compared to a multinode installation.

A **cluster** will usually need more than one **compute node** to host all the **instances** that end users will spawn.


==== The architecture for our demonstration cloud ====
	three nodes, one for each of our logical categories
		* 	 A control node
		* 	 A network node
		* 	 A compute node

	Each node will have two network interfaces.
		**eth0** 192.168.123.0/24 subnet represents the private network.
		**eth1 **192.168.122.0/24 subnet represents the public network
	
	Make sure that your nodes have **several CPUs** and a minimum of **4 to 6 GB of RAM**,
	and install **CentOS or Fedora**

If you're running low on resources, you could __merge the control and network nodes__ into one node and initially run a two-node cluster.
