====== Create Virtual MACHINES Graphic Interface ======
Created Monday 25 January 2016


===== Verifiy Network Conection: =====
	**check if it has an IP address**
		//ip addr ls dev eth0  # the new iproute tools//
		//ifconfig eth0        # old ifconfig//
	check if the Ethernet link is up
		ip link ls dev eth0  # look for LOWER_UP
		ethtool eth0         # look for Link detected: yes
	 a port may be "down" in software as well, in which case it may not have a link, despite being plugged in
		ip link ls dev etho  # look for UP
		ifconfig eth0        # look for UP / RUNNING (on the same line as the other flags)


===== Instal KVM =====
	yum intall qemu-kvm python-virtinst virt-manager virt-top virt-viewer libvirt libvirt-client
	

===== Show the number of VM using the module KVM =====
	lsmod  | grep kvm
	modprobe kvm
	lsmod  | grep kvm


==== Images are Stored at ====
	[[/var/lib/libvirt/images/]]
	(optional) link image directory to another directory -example
		mkdir -p [[/home/qemu/images]]
		chown -R qemu.qemu [[/home/qemu]]
		chcon --reference 	[[/var/lib/libvirt/images]] [[/home/qemu/images]]
		rmdir 	[[/var/lib/libvirt/images/]]
		ln -s  [[/home/qemu/images]] [[/var/lib/libvirt/images]]
		cd [[/var/lib/libvirt/]]
		ls -l


===== Start Service libvirtd =====
	service libvirtd start
	virt-manager
