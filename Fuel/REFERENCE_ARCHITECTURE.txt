====== REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE ======

In Fuel, you can deploy an environment with a single controller node and then add extra ones.

The OpenStack environment consists of multiple physical server nodes (or an equivalent VM), each of which is one of the following node types:

**Controller**:
    The Controller manages all activities in the environment. The nova-controller maintains the life cycle of the OpenStack controller.

	**HA** environment must consist of at least 3 controllers in order to achieve HA for MySQL/Galera cluster. 

**Compute**:
    Compute servers are the workhorses of your installation; they are the servers on which your users' virtual machines are created. nova-compute controls the life cycle of these VMs; Neutron Agent and Ceilometer Compute Agent may also run on Compute nodes.

**Storage:**
    OpenStack requires block and object storage to be provisioned. These __can be provisioned as Storage nodes or as roles that run on Compute nodes__.
	
	__The key principle is that your controller(s) are separate from the compute servers on which your user's VMs run.__


==== Details of Multi-node with HA Deployment ====

A **virtual IP address** (VIP or VIPA) is an IP address that doesn't correspond to an actual physical network interface (port). Uses for VIPs include Network Address Translation (especially, One-to-many NAT), fault-tolerance, and mobility.HAProxy

**HAProxy** provides load balancing, proxying, and high availability in a Mirantis OpenStack environment. Each OpenStack controller runs HAProxy, which manages a single External Virtual IP (VIP) for all controller nodes and provides HTTP and TCP load balancing of requests going to OpenStack API services, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.

**Pacemaker**
High-availability resource manager for Linux based clusters. Fuel uses Packemaker with Corosync to implement HA for OpenStack services.
