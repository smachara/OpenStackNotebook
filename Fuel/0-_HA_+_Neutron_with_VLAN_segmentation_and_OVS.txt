====== 0- HA + Neutron with VLAN segmentation and OVS ======
Created Monday 18 April 2016

    **Deploying mode: Multi-node HA**
**    Networking model: Neutron with VLAN segmentation and OVS**

=== Hardware and environment: ===

    7 servers with two 1Gb/s ethernet NIC and IPMI
    2 Cisco Catalyst 3750 switch
    Independent out of band management network for IPMI
    Connection to the Internet or/and DC network via a router called Gateway and IP 172.16.1.1

=== Node servers roles: ===
Network Conf Plan 
    1 server as Fuel Node
    3 servers as Controller Node
    1 server as Cinder Node
    2 servers as Compute Node

 [[+Calculate floating and public IP addresses]]

=== Network Configuration Plan: ===


**public IP range: 6**
    Floating/Public network 172.16.0.0/24 in VLAN 100 (untagged on servers)

**floating IP range with DVR For VLAN segmentation: 8**
    Floating IP range 172.16.0.130 - 254

    Internal network (private) 192.168.111.0/24
    Gateway 192.168.111.1
    DNS 8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8
    Tunnel ID range 2 - 65535
  
  Management network 192.168.0.0/24 in VLAN 101
  Storage network 192.168.1.0/24 in VLAN 102
  Administrative network (for Fuel) 10.20.0.0/24 in VLAN 103

=== Network Parameters ===

    Fuel server: IP 10.20.0.2/24
    Default gateway: 10.20.0.1
    DNS: 10.20.0.1


Note

The Internet and rest of DC access via Public network (for OpenStack Nodes) and Administrative network (Fuel server).

From server side, ports with following VLAN IDs are used:

    eth0 - Administrative VLAN 103 (untagged)
    eth1 - Public/Floating VLAN 100 (untagged), Management VLAN 101 (tagged), Storage VLAN 102 (tagged)
