Hi, Everybody.
  Last week I  had a "time out error", deploying only one controller node on one virtual machine, searching for the error I found that my hard disk doesn't have enought space (110GB), So I mounted  another HHD  linked VBox folder to this new disk, then I re-started with a clean instalation of Fuel.  
  Now, I found a diferent error  "Deployment has failed. Method granular_deploy. Deployment failed on nodes 1. Inspect Astute logs for the details."

Here is  the "Diagnostic Snapshot" and the Astute log.
