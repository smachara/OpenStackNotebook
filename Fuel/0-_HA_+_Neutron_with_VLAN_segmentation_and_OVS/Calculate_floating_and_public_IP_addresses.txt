	==== OpenStack environment requirements: ====

    
	**Value** 		**Parameter**
		7 		nodes in total
						* 1 server as Fuel Node
						* 3 servers as Controller Node
						* 1 server as Cinder Node
						* 2 servers as Compute Node 
		4 		Number of virtual routers for all the tenants. The virtual routers must be connected to the external network.
		
		32 		Number of virtual machines that require direct access to the external network
						Amount of RAM per VM 	4 GB RAM with dynamic allocation for up to 12 GB
						Local storage per VM 	150 GB
						Persistent volume storage per VM 	500 GB
						**virtual machines per compute node** = //number of virtual machines/number of servers//
						32/2 = 16
		3 		Number of extra IP addresses. Typically, this value equals 3 and includes the following:
						* 1 virtual IP address for virtual router
						* 1 public virtual IP address
						* 1 IP address for default gateway

**public IP range: **[(number of controller nodes + number of zabbix nodes) + number of extra IP addresses]
	number of controller nodes = 3
	number of zabbix nodes = 0
	number of extra IP addresses = 3
	
	[(3 + 0) + 3] = 6
 
**floating IP range without DVR:**  [number of virtual routers for all tenants + number of VMs]

	number of virtual routers for all tenants = 4
	number of VMs = 32
	
	[4 + 32] = 36
	
**floating IP range with DVR:**
	* **For VLAN segmentation:** (number of controller nodes + number of extra IP addresses) + number of compute nodes
			number of controller nodes = 3
			number of extra IP addresses = 3
			number of compute nodes = 2
			
			(3 + 3) + 2 = 8

	* **For GRE segmentation:** (number of controller nodes + number of other nodes + number of extra IP addresses) + number of compute nodes

			number of controller nodes = 3
			number of other nodes = 4
			number of extra IP addresses = 3
			number of compute nodes = 2

			(3 + 4 + 3) + 2 = 12
