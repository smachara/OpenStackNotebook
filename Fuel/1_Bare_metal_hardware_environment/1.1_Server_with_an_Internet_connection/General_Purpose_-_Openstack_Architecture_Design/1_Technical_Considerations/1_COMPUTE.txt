====== 1 COMPUTE ======
Created Tuesday 12 April 2016

			**-** selecting a processor:
					- features and performance characteristics (features can have a significant impact on the performance of your virtual machine):
						[ ] hardware-assisted virtualization
						[ ] memory paging (EPT shadowing)
			**-** number of processors:
			
			**-** amount of memory:
				- Overcommit ratio:
					(the ratio of available virtual resources to available physical resources, CPU and memory)
						16vCPU : 1CPU   1.5vRAM: 1RAM
			**-** compute requirements of non-hypervisor nodes (resource nodes = controller, object storage, and block storage nodes, and networking services):
				 - number of processor cores:
				 - number of threads:
				
			**-** quantity of storage required for each hypervisor:
			
			**-** provide compute resources in: 
				[ ] a single pool or
				[*] in multiple pools. (bin packing) 
					* A compute design that allocates multiple pools of resources makes best use of application resources
					* Requires a common hardware design
					  This makes it easier to //deploy//, //support//, and //maintain// nodes throughout their lifecycle.
