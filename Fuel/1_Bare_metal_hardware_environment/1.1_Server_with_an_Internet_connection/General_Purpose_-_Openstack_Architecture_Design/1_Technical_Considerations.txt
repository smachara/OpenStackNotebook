==== OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ====
		* **Controller infrastructure**
			The Controller infrastructure nodes provide management services to the end-user as well as providing services internally for the operating of the cloud. The Controllers run message queuing services that carry system messages between each service. 
			
			__It is important to properly design the hardware used to run the controller infrastructure__
			
			  ->Ensure that the APIs and Horizon services are load tested to ensure that you are able to serve your customers.
			  ->Particular attention should be made to the OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone), 
		
		* **Compute host**
			Hardware specifications used in compute nodes directly affects the performance of the instances.(CPU, memory and disk type)

			__Running general purpose OpenStack environments it is possible to keep to the defaults, but make sure to monitor your environment as usage increases.__
			
			Default OpenStack Compute set a 16:1 over-commit of the CPU and 1.5 over-commit of the memory.

		* **High Availability **http://docs.openstack.org/ha-guide/
				The infrastructure should always be available, especially when operating with SLAs.
				
				 A consideration of the number of switches, routes and redundancies of power should be factored into core infrastructure.
				The associated bonding of networks to provide diverse routes to your highly available switch infrastructure.
				
				Ensure your deployment has adequate back-up capabilities.
		* **Security **http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/
			security domains are:
			    - Public: //untrusted//
						The public security domain is an entirely untrusted area of the cloud infrastructure. (the internet or networks over which you have no authority.)
		
			    - Guest:  //untrusted//
						It handles compute data generated by instances on the cloud but not services that support the operation of the cloud, such as API calls.
			
			    - Management: //trusted//
						Sometimes referred to as the control plane, the networks in this domain transport confidential data such as configuration parameters, user names, and passwords.
			
			    - Data:
					Much of the data that crosses this network has high integrity and confidentiality requirements and, depending on the type of deployment, may also have strong availability requirements.
					
					The trust level of this network is heavily dependent on other deployment decisions.


				The domains and their trust requirements depend upon whether the cloud instance is public, private, or hybrid.

				Private cloud it is usually behind the firewall and within the trusted network alongside existing systems.
