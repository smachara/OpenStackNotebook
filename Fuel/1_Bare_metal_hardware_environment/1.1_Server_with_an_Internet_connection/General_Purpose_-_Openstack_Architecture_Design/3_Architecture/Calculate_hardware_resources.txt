===== Environment prerequisites  =====
Number of VMs 					100
Amount of RAM per VM 				4 GB RAM with dynamic allocation for up to 12 GB
Local storage per VM 				150 GB
Persistent volume storage per VM 		500 GB
Total persistent storage (object or block) 	50 TB

Compute units 						6 compute nodes with 2 sockets, 8 cores per socket, 2 GHz
Network requirements 	
•     At least 100 Mbit/sec per VM
•     High availability
•     Latency-insensitive network storage
 

===== Calculate CPU =====

	1. **number of CPU cores per virtual machine** = max GHz/(number of GHz per core x 1.3) 
																					//If you do not use hyper-threading, use 2 instead.//
	2. **total number of CPU cores** = (number of VMs x number of GHz per VM)/number of GHz per core. 
	3. **number of sockets** = total number of CPU cores/number of cores per socket
	4. Round the number of sockets up to the next even number.
	5. **number of servers **= total number of sockets/number of sockets per server
	6. **number of virtual machines per compute node** = number of virtual machines/number of servers //(Round this result to the whole number)//

===== Calculate memory =====

	1. **total amount of RAM per compute node =** amount of RAM per VM x number of VMs per compute node
	2. **RAM required to accommodate the core operating system operations =** total amount of RAM per compute node + RAM for core OS operations
	3. Round the amount of RAM you calculated in step 2 to the number that fits your server configuration and your selection of computer memory modules.
	
	For example, for a 2 CPU socket board that typically has 16 memory slots and 16 GB memory modules, you assign 256 GB RAM.
