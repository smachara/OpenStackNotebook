	* what type of configuration addresses your business needs.
	* calculate resources required to process estimated workloads
 
For a production environment, you must decide on the following
	[ ] Network topology and IP address management plan
	[ ] Storage
	[ ] Number, type, and flavor of compute, controller, storage, and other nodes
	[ ] Monitoring facilities
	[ ] Additional components: Sahara and Murano
	[ ] Fuel plug-ins
